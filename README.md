# unity_daoc
Unity DAoC scenery testing

## Info
This have some basic classes to load DAoC (extracted) zone data to Unity

Note: this is missing two support classes, IniParser and PcxLoader as those are copy&paste from somewhere if I recall correctly.

Heightmap loading was ok in Unity, but texture "splatter" was not working nicely.
I didn't manage to get size correctly for textures and also looks too repeated (missing rotation?)
